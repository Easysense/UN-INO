Introduction
In the recent years, face recognition applications have been developed on a much larger scale. Image classification and recognition has evolved and is being used at a number of places. I recently read an article where a face recognition application has been deployed at one of the airports for a completely automated check in process.

Image Classification

This will alleviate the need for manual intervention and provide a seamless end to end check in process via technology. It looks like a magical application for normal human beings but I will be talk about what is required for you to build an application of this kind on your own mobile phone.

Applications
Face Recognition – Phone cameras use face recognition for unlocking the phone. Face recognition systems could be deployed at entry gates of office buildings.
Image Classification – It is used for distinguishing between multiple image sets. Industries like automobile, retail, gaming etc. are using this for multiple purposes.
Image Recognition – Security companies use image recognition for detecting various things in bags at the airports, image scanners etc.
