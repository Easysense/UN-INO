As a technology company we have a common GITHub repository but as we are working on multiple projects so we cannot share that profile with you right now. But as we need to share some resources for this project, we have recently created a new GITHub repository where we have added all the possible solutions aligned with this project. But there might be less data right now because we will be using some resources from some of our previous projects, but as we haven’t been selected yet so we cannot share those resources right at this moment. But if we get selected in this challenge then we will surely share all the available data that we already have and are developing . And due to the pandemic consequences, a lot of our work has been hampered as we need to work physically . That’s why there might be less data than your expectations. But if we get proper support from your end then we believe we will be able to achieve all these by our expertise achieved from working in this sector.
